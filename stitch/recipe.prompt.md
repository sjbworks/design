# Design a modern recipe website homepage with the following specifications:

## Layout & Structure:

- Each card contains: recipe photo at top, recipe title below, and cooking time + difficulty level + category tag displayed in a single horizontal row at the bottom
- Sticky header with logo and search bar
- Sidebar or top navigation for category filtering

## Color Scheme:

- Main color: Orange (#FF6B35 or similar warm orange)
- Base color: Cream/Off-white (#FFF8F0) for backgrounds
- Accent color: Sky blue/Light blue (#7EC8E3 or #89CFF0) to complement orange
- Text: Charcoal gray (#2D3142) for readability

## Key Features:

1. Prominent search bar at the top - placeholder text "レシピ名や材料で検索..."
2. Category filter chips/buttons (朝食, 昼食, 夕食, デザート, ベジタリアン, etc.) - horizontally scrollable on mobile
3. Recipe cards with subtle hover effects - slight lift and shadow
4. Smooth scroll animations and micro-interactions on tap/click

## Design Style:

- Clean, minimal aesthetic with cute, playful touches
- Rounded corners on cards (8-12px border radius)
- Soft shadows for depth
- Cute, friendly icons for categories
- Modern sans-serif typography (e.g., Poppins, Inter, Noto Sans JP)
- Ample white space for breathing room

## Interactions & Animations:

- Smooth fade-in on scroll for recipe cards
- Gentle bounce effect when tapping category filters
- Search bar expands slightly on focus
- Card images have subtle zoom on hover
- Loading skeleton screens for better UX

## Target Platform: Web (desktop, tablet, and mobile responsive)

## Mood & Inspiration:

- Target audience: Home cooks looking for simple, delicious recipes
- Mood: Warm, inviting, and approachable - like a friendly cooking companion
- Inspiration: Pinterest meets modern Japanese minimalism with a cozy touch

## IMPORTANT Requirements:

- All text content in the design (labels, buttons, navigation, sample recipe names, etc.) must be in Japanese
- Create separate designs for these exact screen widths: Mobile (375px), Tablet (768px), Desktop (1440px)
- Card metadata (cooking time, difficulty, category tag) must be displayed in a single horizontal row
- DO NOT include any FAB (Floating Action Button) - no add/edit functionality needed
- DO NOT include Footer - this is a view and search only page
- DO NOT include account icon at the top
- DO NOT include bottom navigation bar
